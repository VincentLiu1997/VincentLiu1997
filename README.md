- Hi, Iâ€™m Shijia Liu. I am a Ph.D. student in the Advanced Robotics lab [@ARQ](https://www.robotics.qmul.ac.uk/) at Queen Mary University of London, supervised by Dr.Ketao Zhang. My research is mainly focused on mobile robotics fusion with advanced sensing and manipulation.
- Prior to my Ph.D. program, I received my master's degree in Robotics and AI from the University of Glasgow, where I was fortunate to be supervised by Professor David Flynn and work with Dr. Daniel Mitchell as well as all my friends. Before that, I was granted my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (BUCT).
- Please feel free to reach out to me via shijia.liu@qmul.ac.uk if you have any questions.
